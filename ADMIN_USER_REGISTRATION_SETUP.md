# Admin User Registration Setup

To enable admin user registration functionality, you need to add the Supabase Service Role Key to your environment variables.

## Steps to Setup:

### 1. Get Your Service Role Key
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **API**
3. Copy the **service_role** key (not the anon key)

### 2. Add Environment Variable
Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
After adding the environment variable, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What This Enables:
- Admins can create new users directly from the admin panel
- Users are created with the specified role (admin or assistant)
- Email confirmation is automatically handled
- User profiles are automatically created via database triggers

## Security Note:
The service role key has elevated permissions and should:
- Only be used in server-side code (never exposed to the client)
- Only be stored in environment variables
- Never be committed to version control
- Be treated as a secret credential

## Testing:
Once setup is complete, admins will see a "Register New User" button on the Users page where they can:
- Enter user email, password, full name
- Select user role (admin or assistant)
- Create the user account immediately

The new user will then be able to log in with the provided credentials.
